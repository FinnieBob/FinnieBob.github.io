											<h3>'X-Wing' Combat Game VR<br>Oculus Quest 2 (Unity)</h3>
											<p>This is my own fan made re-imagining of the classic LucasArts game 'X-Wing' developed for the Oculus Quest VR hardware.<br>Battle up to 32 AI bots over several scenarios inspired by the films or dogfight with other players in multiplayer</p>

											<h3>90's Retro Football Game<br>PC, Mac, Mobile (Unity)</h3>
											<p>Inspired by Sensible Software's 1990s classic football game 'Sensible Soccer', this was originally created in the late 90's using my own game and physics engine in C++. I re-visitied this a few years ago and re-coded it in Unity using C# in order to experiment with AI and Machine Learning agents.<br>Faithful to the original, this game is fast, fluid, challenging and is great fun with 2 players</p>

											<h3>Realtime 3D Pose Estimation & Mapping from Video</h3>
											<p>This project used Unity and the Barracuda Neural Network inference library to provide realtime pose estimation from 2D video. The 2D skeleton was then transformed into a 3D model using inverse kinematics.<br>This was originally designed as an ad hoc motion capture tool to create character animations for other projects</p>

											<h3><strong>Project 'THISTLE'. Command & Control (C2) Software Suite. British MoD, NATO C3A</strong></h3>
								
											<p>During my time at the Microprocessor Applications Group at Cranfield University, I was a lead developer and engineer on many projects for the British MoD and NATO. Main activity was the development of Command and Control, Communications Planning and Wargaming software tools with a focus on rapid prototyping. An broad suite of C3 tools, developed between 1994-2010, these were used extensively both in training and military exercise and deployed live in theatre (Bosnia & Afghanistan)</p>

											<h3><strong>
    CADUCEUS (EW Training & Simulation Suite)</strong></h3>
	<p>Developed in conjunction with The Royal School of Signals (RSS)
    This software training simulation was developed during my time at Cranfield University. It utilised the SPECTRA/THISTLE project. It was used by training staff to emulate a series of EW transmissions to be detected by students.
    The exercise DS would provide students with a list of Electronic Warfare assets that can be deployed in specified areas of responsibility.
    To aid the deployment of assets the tool has a number of communications testing functions that can be used to determine the optimum location for each asset.
    Once deployment is complete, the scenario will run in real time enabling students to build-up a picture of troop movements based on detections made.
    To aid construction of the movement picture, students within each cell can use the system to share information</p>

								<h2>About Me</h2>
							

								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>

								<p>I am a highly experienced Senior Software Engineer with over 30 years of professional software development experience. I am a full-stack developer with expertise in a wide range of operating systems, languages, and design methodologies. I have a proven track record in innovative design and programming and have also worked as an MSc course designer and lecturer. I am an IET published author on Digital Signal and Image Processing techniques and have competency in multiple programming languages including C, C++, C#, Python, Fortran, Pascal and ASMx86. I have many years of experience in Unity, 3D, VR, Oculus, and have developed for various platforms such as PC, Android, Linux, and UNIX. I have a proven track record in designing and developing software and hardware solutions for a wide range of applications, primarily in the fields of defence, command and control systems (C2), robotics, war gaming, simulations, and VR. I am currently an independent software consultant and developer, and have worked for the Royal School of Signals (UK MoD), NATO C3 Agency and Cranfield University. During my career at Cranfield University, I also supervised MSc students and served as a Viva examiner.</p>
